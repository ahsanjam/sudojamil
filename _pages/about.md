:man_student: I am a final year Graduate student at Arden University studying MS Data Sciences.

I completed my Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering which built my passion for problem solving.

However what I realised was that using Data, you can solve for many problems in multiple industries
hence my varied experiences working as a Product/Data/Business Analyst for companies in different industries
like US Mobile, Daraz, Noon and currently Solaris.

Having acquired some practical experience, my Masters has motivated me to reconnect with the academia side
and currently my research interests are in Computer Vision projects, specifically Semantic Segmentation.

On this website, you can find my resume and a portfolio of my personal projects that I did on Kaggle and other
open-source datasets.
